        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            My name is [Your Name], and I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While my academic focus was on the arts, my true passion lies in the world of technology and computers. I have always been fascinated by how things work and am driven by the desire to learn new skills.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            I am currently a trainee at <span class="font-semibold">Deshpande Skills</span>, where I am dedicated to developing my expertise in **ICT (Information and Communications Technology)**. This program has allowed me to dive deep into new topics and hone my skills, particularly in coding. I believe that learning is a continuous process, and I thrive on the challenge of understanding things I don't know.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My goal is to use my passion and my growing skills to create and build new things. I am excited to continue my journey in technology and look forward to what I will create next.
